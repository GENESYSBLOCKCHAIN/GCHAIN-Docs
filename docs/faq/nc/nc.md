# Genesys Chain

## What is Genesys Chain?

Genesys Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with Genesys Chain using an innovative consensus of [Proof of Authority(PoA)](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md)

## Why is Genesys Chain designed as a separate chain from Genesys Chain?

The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. Even if that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of Genesys Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

## How does Genesys Chain work? What is the architecture and consensus used?

Genesys Chain relies on a system with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.

There will be fewer validators on Genesys Chain testnet.

## Can you tell more about Proof of Staked Authority(PoSA)? What is it?

[PoSA](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md) is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner

## What are the benefits for developers to build on Genesys Chain?

* EVM-compatible: Genesys Chain supports all the existing Ethereum tooling
Fast block time, cheaper cost
* Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: GSYS DEX remains a liquid venue of exchange of assets on Genesys Chain and Genesys Chain"

## What are the benefits for developers to build on Genesys Chain?

Genesys Chain opens the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading

## What make Genesys Chain different?

Key Innovations:

* Proof-of-authority Consensus

* Native Cross-Chain Communication

* Expand the use cases of GSYS token

## Genesys Chain is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?

EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to Genesys Chain.

## Can developers make hybrid Dapps using both Genesys Chain and Genesys Chain in one single Dapp?

Yes, with the help of native cross-chain functions
